# Atom - Elegant & Awesome, Simple & Powerful

Atom is a component-based PHP 5.3 library that implements self-contained,
scalable and non-blocking development tools and functionality. Its primary goal
is performance, without loss of functionality.

Atom was built to be as simple as possible to set up, configure, and deploy
as either a standable application+framework, or integrate into an existing
architecture.

The source code for Atom is in the
[public domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Domain).
